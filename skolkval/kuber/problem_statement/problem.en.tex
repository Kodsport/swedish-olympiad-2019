\illustration{.45}{cubes.png}{Nadja's cubes (cc by-sa Swedish Olympiad in Informatics 2018)}%
Nadja is gluing together small wooden cubes with a side length of 1 to form larger compact cubes. 
She has now decided that she wants one cube of each side length from 1 to N. 
How many small cubes does Nadja need?

\section*{Input}
The input consists of a single integer N on the first and only line, $1 \leq N \leq 100$.

\section*{Output}
The program should output a single line containing an integer: the number of small cubes Nadja needs.

\section*{Scoring}
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{| l | l | p{12cm} |}
  \hline
  \textbf{Group} & \textbf{Points} & \textbf{Constraints} \\ \hline
  $1$    & $20$       & $N = 10$ \\ \hline
  $2$    & $80$       & No additional constraints. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Explanation of Example}
In example 1, Nadja wants one cube of each side length from $1$ to $4$.
Thus, she needs $1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = 100$ small cubes.
