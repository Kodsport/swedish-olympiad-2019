# Testdata Tools

`gen.sh` contains bash helper functions for working with problems for the
Kattis format, particularly ones that use multiple test groups.
See `generator_example.sh` or `generator_example_acm.sh` for example usage.

There used to be CMS support. If you need that, look at the repo history.

This directory is intended to be copied into your contest's top-level directory
and committed. `gen.sh` may be changed freely if needed.
